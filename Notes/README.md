Welcome to the Updated JavaScript Note Collection! ðŸ¥³ I've finished my notes but decided to redo them, add more content, and enhance my understanding of the language.

I love both the front-end and the back-end, and I'm focused on expanding my knowledge to be able to build more complex applications.

This time around, it also includes diving into TypeScript and Node.js.

> [!NOTE] 
This is a Note-Collection which reflects my personal learning journey. I'm not a professional developer, and I don't claim to be an expert in any of the topics covered.

## How does this work | [Live Docs](https://neonsy.github.io/JavaScript-Note-Collection/)

The `collection` is maintained in two ways:

1.  The notes

    These are the code files, with comments for a bare bones / to the core type of explanation. You can use the files, to run the code yourself. Their use if for a more practical / hands on approach and if you just want focus on what's needed.

2.  The live documentation website

    The [live docs](https://neonsy.github.io/JavaScript-Note-Collection/) are featuring everything the notes do, with the potential of extra information and in a more fully fledged and comprehensive way. This is useful for those who want as much information as possible. I'll add to and / or update my entries as time permits it. These docs are also optimized for a mobile viewing.

## The Plan

While [this.README.md](/Notes/README.md) will probably change and this part removed towards the end, I'm going to lay out the rough plan / vision I have for this Note Collection.

-  JavaScript: The Core language
-  TypeScript
-  NodeJS
-  Mini Projects

## Code Sandboxes

If you want to play around with the code, you can use one of the corresponding sandboxes.
