As you may have already heard, JavaScript has two types of variables, `let` and `const`.
You'd probably excpect that `const` stands for making a variable `constant`, or rather the value?
Well, you can already see the problem.

Before we dive into the topic, let's first understand what a `constant` variable is meant to do.
When you make _something_ `constant`, you can't change the that due to immutability.

:::info
When something is `immutable`, it means that it can't be changed.
However, what you actually make `immutable` differs from language to language.
:::

## Looking at C#

In C#, the `const` keyword is used to define `constant` values that are known at compile time and cannot be changed.
However, `const` can only be applied to primitive types and strings, not to objects.

If you want to create an immutable object, you should use the readonly keyword instead.
The readonly keyword can be used with fields, and it ensures that the field can only be assigned a value once, either at the time of declaration or in the constructor of the class.
However, if the field is a reference type (<span className="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400">like an object</span>), you can still modify the attributes of the object it points to.

## Looking at Java

Java does not have a `const` keyword, but it has final which can be used to create `constants`.
When applied to objects, the reference cannot be changed, but the object's fields can still be modified unless they are also declared as final.

## So what about JavaScript?

JavaScript, and therefore TypeScript, uses `const` to declare variables whose value cannot be reassigned.
However, the properties of objects or elements of arrays can still be modified.

Why? To understand that, let's look at pointers in C++.

:::info
Python does not even bother having a `const` keyword, which is kinda funny. When writing Python, you have to rely on naming conventions, to mark something as a `constant`.
:::

### Pointers in C++

Don't worry, you do not have to like that topic in order to be able to follow along.

#### The `const` keyword

So, when you're having a pointer to a variable and that pointer is `constant`, what happens when you try to change the value of the variable that the pointer points to?

Let's look at the following code:

```cpp title="Const as a pointer"
int num = 10;
int* const ptr = &num;
*ptr = 20;
```

This is allowed because the value pointed to by `ptr` can still be modified.

As you can see, we have a variable `num` that has the value `10`.
Then, we have a pointer `ptr` that points to the variable `num`.
That pointer is `constant`, so we <span className="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400">can't change the value of **the pointer**.</span>

How would you change the value of the variable that the pointer points to?
Well, by just changing the value of the variable that the pointer points to, using the `*` syntax.

#### What about `let`?

We can draw a parallel between `let` and pointers as well, with the example being almost identical.

Let's look at the following code again, with some slight changes:

```cpp title="Let as a pointer"
int num1 = 10;
int num2 = 20;
int* ptr = &num1;
int* const ptr2 = ptr;
ptr = &num2;
```

We still have a `const` pointer `ptr2`, that points to the value `num1` at first.
The difference is that we can now change the value of the pointer `ptr2` is pointing to, because `ptr2` is points to a non `constant` pointer.

All of that basically means that if `ptr` changes what it's pointing to, so does `ptr2`.

#### Conclusion

The conclusion is that while `const` and `let` in JavaScript have specific behaviors regarding reassignment and mutability, their equivalents in C++ can be understood through the use of pointers and constant pointers.

`Const` is `*` and `let` is `**`.

### Looking at objects in JavaScript

So while the pointer example above points at the differences between `let` and `const`, there's still something we need to address.

#### What is an object?

Everything that is <span className="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400">not</span> a primitive type is an object in JavaScript.
That includes arrays, functions, maps etc.

A primitive type (<span className="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400">like an integer or a boolean</span>) stores its value directly in the memory allocated for the variable.
For example, if you have an integer variable with a value of 5, the memory location for that variable will directly contain the number 5.

An object however, stores a reference (<span className="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400">or pointer</span>) to the memory location where the actual data is stored.
So, when you create an object, the variable holds the address of where the object's data is located, not the data itself.
This means that if you have two variables referring to the same object, changes made through one variable will be reflected when accessing the object through the other variable.

#### What does that have to do with `const`?

When you use `const` in JavaScript, you are declaring that the variable cannot be reassigned.
However, the properties of the object can still be changed, because you are holding a reference to the object, not the object itself.

This in return means, that if you have a `const` variable for an integer, you cannot change the value of the variable, because the variable holds the value and not a reference.
:::info
This is a slight guess on my end, because it still depends on how the language handles these types in the end.
Therefore, I'm basing my explaination on the mixture of what I know about the language and what I've learned about memory.
:::

## When to use `const` vs `let`?

My personal recommendation is to always use `const` by default.
This will help you avoid mistakes, especially when you're exporting something from a module.

Only use `let` when you need to change the value of a variable.
Preferably, use `let` when you want to make changes immediately after the initial declaration.

For example, you could declare a variable with `let` and then use it in a `for` loop or a `switch` statement.

> I mean, you can always switch it at the declaration, if the need arises.

## True immutability

When reading through all of this, you might be wondering: How can we make sure that the attributes / items of an object are not going to be changed?

Well, JavaScript got you covered with the `object.freeze()` method.
This method will freeze the object and prevent any changes to the object's attributes.

:::info
If you really want to freeze an object, keep in mind that based on the object's size and dependencies, this might get expansive.
:::

## Summary

JavaScript has two types of variable declarations: `const` and `let`, where `const` prevents reassignment but doesn't make objects truly immutable.

JavaScript's `const` allows object properties to be modified.

:::info
You could of course `const` attributes of a class, but that would probably defeat the purpose of using a class.
:::

Objects in JavaScript store references to memory locations, so using `const` means the reference can't change, but the object's properties still can.

Use `const` by default to avoid reassignment errors, and use `let` when you need to change a variable's value.

For true immutability, JavaScript provides the `Object.freeze()` method to prevent changes to an object's attributes.
