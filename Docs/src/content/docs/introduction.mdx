JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that has revolutionized web development 🌐

In this comprehensive module, we'll embark on an exciting journey to explore the latest and greatest concepts in JavaScript 🚀

Get ready to dive deep into the world of variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and much more, including exciting new features like arrow functions, async/await, and destructuring 🎉

Whether you're a complete beginner or have some coding experience, this module is designed to cater to all levels 🔎

We'll start from the ground up, ensuring that you have a solid foundation before diving into more advanced topics like modules, classes, and modern frameworks 🧱

You'll learn how to use the power of JavaScript to solve problems, build interactive web applications, and bring your ideas to life 💡

So, let's embark on this adventure together and unlock the full potential of this incredible language 🎢

## Where does it fit?

When it comes to developing something in the webspace, it always comes back down to the same three building blocks.

### <span class="text-3xl text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400">HTML</span>

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and content of a web page, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

### <span class="text-3xl text-cyan-600 dark:text-cyan-400">CSS</span>

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page.

### <span class="text-3xl text-yellow-600 dark:text-yellow-400">JavaScript</span>

JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle user input, perform calculations and data processing, as well as retrieve and display data from a server.

## Why learn JavaScript?

JavaScript can be used on both the front-end and back-end development. It is a versatile language that can create interactive web applications, dynamic websites, and server-side applications.

Many argue that JavaScript is the most important language in the world, and it is used in almost every aspect of modern web development, but there's one argument I cannot agree with personally.

> JavaScript is the language to learn, if you want to work on both front-end and back-end, because you can use it for both, only needing to learn a single language.

Why do I disagree with that? Well, while it does of course come in handy, if learning an extra language for the backend is the obstacle, then you might want to think about that first.

:::note
There are plenty of languages that work well for backend-development, such as C#, Go, Java, PHP and Python. These languages can be used for web development, but they can also be used for other backend development tasks.

The reason why I'm interested in JavaScript is the mind melting, rapidly changing mayhem, that comes with JavaScript. Well, to be more precise, it comes from the NodeJS world of frameworks.

So writing plain vanilla JavaScript is like writing vanilla CSS. It's fairly easy and depending on the task, it can be used in a lot of fun and different ways.

However, when it comes to maintaining a scaling application, a framework is the way to go. A framework is a collection of libraries, tools, and best practices that help developers build applications more efficiently.

And this is in my opinion where JavaScript really shines. It's a language that is used in a lot of different frameworks for both the front-end and back-end. So I wouldn't just look at it as a language, but as a tool.

## Quick peak into NodeJS

NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, making it possible to build scalable and high-performance applications.

Like Python, NodeJS comes with a lot of built-in modules and libraries that make it easy to build web applications. It also has a large community of developers who contribute to the ecosystem, making it easy to find solutions to common problems.
