This is the first more exciting part, when it comes to getting to know JavaScript.

There are two main ways to get input from the user via JavaScript:

- Using the `prompt()` function
- Using an HTML textbox of some sort

The first one is the easiest to use, but it's not very customizable.

The latter is more customizable, but it's a bit more complicated to set up.

:::note
I'd recommend focusing on the `prompt()` first, becuase the textbox one requires knowledge, that will be covered later.

So, if you are new to JavaScript, don't worry about the textbox one. It'll get easier later down the line.

## Using the `prompt()` function

As mentioned, the `prompt()` function is used to get input from the user.

This function takes two parameters:

- The text to display to the user
- The default value to display

Let's see an example:

```js title="Input.js"
const name = prompt("What is your name?", "John Doe");

console.log(name);
```

If you run the code, the default value is already _typed_ in the textbox. That is something to consider when using the `prompt()` function.

:::note
There are other ways to handle default values, which you'll learn about in later sections.

## Using an HTML textbox (<span class="font-bold text-yellow-700 dark:text-yellow-500">Advanced</span>)

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the textbox is a bit more complicated to set up, but it's a lot more customizable.

The textbox or input, is an HTML element which can be used to get input from the user.

To be able to fully grasp how to use it, you'll need to know the three following things:

- ID's
- Functions
- Event listeners

Let's take a look at the code first:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="HTML Code">
```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <label id="label" for="name">Your name:</label>
        <br />
        <input type="text" id="name" />
        <br />
        <button id="button">Send</button>
        <script src="input.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="JavaScript Code">
```js title="Input.js"
const label = document.getElementById("label");

const button = document.getElementById("button");

button.onclick = function () {
    const name = document.getElementById("name").value;

    label.textContent = `Your name is ${name}`;
};
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Full Code">
```html title="input.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <label id="label" for="name">Your name:</label>
        <br />
        <input type="text" id="name" />
        <br />
        <button id="button">Send</button>
        <script>
            const label = document.getElementById("label");

            const button = document.getElementById("button");

            button.onclick = function () {
                const name = document.getElementById("name").value;

                label.textContent = `Your name is ${name}`;
            };
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Quick explaination

While the code is not that complicated, from a beginners perspective, it can be quite confusing.

Therefore, let's take a quick look at the parts, that are important to understand.

#### ID's

In HTML, ID's (identifiers) are unique strings assigned to elements.
They serve as a way to identify and reference specific elements within the document.
Each ID must be unique within the HTML document, meaning no two elements can share the same ID.

ID's are particularly useful for:

-   Applying styles via CSS.
-   Accessing and manipulating elements through JavaScript.
-   And so much more.

For example, if an element has an ID of `myElement`, you can use `document.getElementById('myElement')` in JavaScript to access and manipulate that element.

:::note
There are several ways to identify HTML elements, such as classes, attributes, and tag names, which will be covered in a later section.
:::

#### Functions

In JavaScript, functions are blocks of code designed to perform particular tasks.
They are executed when "called" (invoked).

In the provided JavaScript code, functions are used to interact with HTML elements.
For instance, a function might be triggered when a user clicks a button, and it could then retrieve the value from a textbox and display it in a label.

#### Event listeners

Event listeners in JavaScript are used to execute code in response to events triggered by user interactions, such as clicks, key presses, or mouse movements.

In the provided JavaScript code, event listeners are used to perform actions when users interact with HTML elements.
For example, an `onclick` event listener might be added to a button to call a function when the button is clicked.

### Logical rundown

Now that we've covered the basics, let's look at the code in a proper manner.

#### HTML

The `HTML` code features a label, a textbox, and a button.

The label is used to display the text "`Your name:`".
This is useful, because the textbox is empty, and the label is the only way to know what the textbox is for.
Unless you use the placeholder attribute of the input element.

The textbox is used to get the users name, or any input really.

The button is used to provide an element, typically within the context of a form.

#### JavaScript

The first line of the JavaScript code is used to get a reference to the label element.

The second line of the JavaScript code is used to get a reference to the button element.

Then, we have the `onclick` event listener.
The `onclick` event listener is used to execute code, usually a function, when the button is clicked.

In this case, the function that is being executed `onclick`, gets the value from the textbox.
Afterwards, the label is updated with the value from the textbox.

## Next

Now that was quite something wasn't it?

I hope this article has provided you with a solid understanding of working with input in JavaScript.

Don't worry if you've stumbled with the advanced input mechanism.
Keep practicing and exploring.

I think we should take a look at Datatypes next.
