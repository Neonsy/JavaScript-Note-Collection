JavaScript has a variety of data types that can be categorized into two main groups: 

- Primitives
- Complex / Reference types

## Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are the most basic data types in JavaScript.
They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once created.

:::note
This applies when using `const`, because `let` let's you still reassign a value.

You can read more about it [<span class="text-yellow-700 dark:text-yellow-500">here</span>](/JavaScript-Note-Collection/references/const-vs-let/).
:::

### Undefined

The `undefined` data type is used to represent a value that is undefined.

In essence, that means a variable has been declared but has not received a value yet.
Think of it as an empty box that hasn't been filled with anything.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let x;
console.log(x);
```

```js title="Output"
undefined
```

### Null

The `null` data type is used to represent a value that is, well... null.

In other words, it represent the **intentional absence** of any value, or at least it should be signaling that.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let y = null;
console.log(y);
```

```js title="Output"
null
```

### Boolean

The `boolean` data type is used to represent a value that is either `true` or `false`.
It's like a light switch that can either be on or off.

An expression in JavaScript that evaluates to `true` is called a `truthy` expression, while one that evaluates to `false` is called a `falsy` expression.

What qualifies as expression? A piece of code that produces a value.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;
```

### Number

The `number` data type is used to represent a value that is a number.
While that does sound self explanatory, it's important to note that it can be either a `float` or an `integer`.

:::note
JavaScript does not differentiate between different types of numbers, so you can use the same type for whole numbers and decimal ones.
:::

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let integer = 42;
let float = 3.14;
```

#### BigInt

The `bigint` data type is used for whole numbers larger than what the `Number` type can safely represent.
You create a BigInt by appending `n` to the end of an integer.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

### String

The `string` data type is used to represents a sequence of characters used to represent text.
You can create strings by enclosing characters in single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (`` ` ``).

Backticks are especially useful, when you are working with variables.
You can use them to enclose a variable name and then reference it inside the backticks.
This is referred to as [template literals](/JavaScript-Note-Collection/javascript/basics/output/#using-template-literals).

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let singleQuoteString = 'Hello';
let doubleQuoteString = "World";
let templateLiteral = `Hello, ${doubleQuoteString}`;
```

### Symbol

Symbols represents a unique and immutable value that can be used as the key of an object property.

They are created using the `Symbol()` function.

**Key Points**:

- Uniqueness: Each symbol is unique. Even if two symbols have the same description, they are different.
- Use Case: Symbols are useful for creating unique property keys, especially in scenarios where you want to avoid property name collisions.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let sym1 = Symbol('description');
let sym2 = Symbol('description');

console.log(sym1 === sym2);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
false
```
</details>

:::note
The tripple equals sign (`===`) is used to check if two values are equal. This will be covered in a later section.
:::

## Complex (Reference) Data Types

Complex data types are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
They are mutable, meaning they can be modified after creation.

:::note
I will go over most of these data types in detail, in their own sections.
This section only serves as a broad overview of the different data types.
:::

### Object

`Objects` are a collection of key-value pairs.
They can store properties (`data`) and methods (`functions`).

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let obj = {
  name: 'Devin',
  age: 36,
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello');
  }
};
```

### Array

`Arrays` are a collection of values.
They are similar to objects, but they are not key-value pairs.
However, they are a special type of object.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

### Function

`Functions` are a special type of object that can be called to perform a task.
They are defined using the `function` keyword or arrow syntax (`=>`).

```js title="Datatypes.js"
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello');
}

let greetArrow = () => {
  console.log('Hello');
};
```

### Date

The `Date` object is used to represent a specific date and time.
They are created using the `Date` constructor.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let now = new Date();
```

### RegExp

Regular expressions are used to represent a pattern of characters, representing a regular expression, which is used for pattern matching within strings.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let regex = /ab+c/;
```

### Map

A `map` represents a collection of key-value pairs where keys can be of any data type.
They are created using the `Map` constructor.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let map = new Map();
map.set('key', 'value');
```

### Set

`Sets` represents a collection of unique values.
They are created using the `Set` constructor.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let set = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```

### WeakMap

A `WeakMap` is similar to a `Map`, but keys must be objects and they are weakly referenced, meaning they can be garbage collected if there are no other references to the object.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let weakMap = new WeakMap();
let obj = {};
weakMap.set(obj, 'value');
```

### WeakSet

In the same sense, a `WeakSet` is similar to `Set`, but values must be objects and they are weakly referenced as well.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let weakSet = new WeakSet();
let obj = {};
weakSet.add(obj);
```

### Promise

A `Promise` represents the eventual completion, _or failure_, of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

```js title="Datatypes.js"
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation
});
```

These data types form the foundation of JavaScript and are essential for understanding how to work with the language effectively.
By mastering these data types, you'll be well on your way to becoming proficient in JavaScript.
