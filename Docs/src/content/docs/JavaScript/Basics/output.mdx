Because JavaScript is meant to run logic and modify HTML, there is no way to display something to the website, without the use of _more advanced_ methods.

This is why you'll learn how to use the `console.log()` method to display something to the console.

## Print to the console

As you may have already noticed with the comment section, there is code that has `()` parentheses. This is known as a function call.

:::note[Remember]
Functions are like mini-programs that can be called from within your code.
:::

The `console.log()` is brought to you by the langauge itself. It takes a variable or a string as an argument.

### Outputting a string

So this can simply be done by calling the function, using it's name and a pair of parentheses.

```js title="Output.js"
console.log("Hello world!");
```

```md title="Result"
Hello world!
```

:::note
In order to see the output in your browser, you need to open the console. This can in most browsers be done by pressing `F12` or `CTRL + SHIFT + I`. In Chrome, as well as Chromium based browsers, you can also open the console by pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + J`.

### Outputting a variable

This is the same as before but we need to have a [variable](/JavaScript-Note-Collection/javascript/basics/variables) defined beforehand.

```js title="Output.js"
let myName = "Timothy";
console.log(myName);
```

```md title="Result"
Timothy
```

### Outputting multiple variables

This can be done by separating the variables with a comma.

```js title="Output.js"
let myName = "Timothy";
let myAge = 23;
console.log(myName, myAge);
```

```md title="Result"
Timothy 23
```

### Outputting variables with a string

To display a variable with a string, you can use concatenation. This can be achieved by using the `+` operator.

```js title="Output.js"
let myName = "Timothy";
let myAge = 23;
console.log("My name is " + myName + " and I am " + myAge + " years old.");
```

```md title="Result" "Timothy" "23"
My name is Timothy and I am 23 years old.
```

#### Using template literals

A template literal is a string that can contain variables. This allows us, to output a string with variables in it, instead of having to use concatenation.

To do that, you need to wrap the string in <span class="text-orange-700 dark:text-orange-400 font-black">`</span> backticks. Your variables will then be wrapped in ``${}`` curly brackets.

```js title="Output.js"
let myName = "Timothy";
let myAge = 23;
console.log(`My name is ${myName} and I am ${myAge} years old.`);
```

```md title="Result" "Timothy" "23"
My name is Timothy and I am 23 years old.
```

## Next

Now that we have learned how to print something to the console, we can move on to the next topic. Can you guess what it is? I'll give you a hint: It has been a part of this topic / section / module / lession.

:::note
I'll probably use these terms interchangeably, because I don't really know which is which.

Well, the navigation link is a dead giveaway, but yeah... The next topic is about variables.
