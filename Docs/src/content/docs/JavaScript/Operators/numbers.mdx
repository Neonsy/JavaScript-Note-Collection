JavaScript, like any _powerful_ programming language, is packed with a variety of math operators.
Get ready to dive into the exciting world of numbers and calculations.

## Basic Operators

Here is a quick rundown, of all the basic operators you'll need to know for arithmetic in JavaScript.
Try to guess the output, before you look at it or run the code.

### Addition (<span class="text-yellow-600 dark:text-yellow-400">+</span>)
The addition operator adds two numbers together.
It's like combining two ingredients to make a delicious recipe!

```js title="Numbers.js"
let sum = 5 + 3;
console.log(sum);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
8
```
</details>

### Subtraction (<span class="text-red-600 dark:text-red-400">-</span>)
The subtraction operator subtracts one number from another.
Think of it as taking away a piece of a pie.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let difference = 10 - 4;
console.log(difference);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
6
```
</details>

### Multiplication (<span class="text-sky-600 dark:text-sky-400">*</span>)
The multiplication operator multiplies two numbers.
It's like doubling a recipe to serve more people.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let product = 7 * 6;
console.log(product);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
42
```
</details>

### Division (<span class="text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-400">/</span>)
The division operator divides one number by another.
Imagine slicing a pizza into equal parts.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let quotient = 20 / 4;
console.log(quotient);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
5
```
</details>

## Extra Operators

### Modulus (<span class="text-lime-600 dark:text-lime-400">%</span>)
The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation.
It's like finding out how many pieces are left after sharing equally.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let remainder = 10 % 3;
console.log(remainder);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
1
```
</details>

### Exponent (<span class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">**</span>)
The exponentiation operator raises the first number to the power of the second number.
It's like multiplying a number by itself and that several times over.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let power = 2 ** 3;
console.log(power);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
8
```
</details>

## Increment and Decrement

There are two types of increment and decrement operators:

- **Pre**-in/decrement: Uses the value after, then increases/decreases it.
- **Post**-in/decrement: Uses the value first, then increases/decreases it.

:::note
Chances are, that you'll see the post increment operator more often.
This is because it's easier to read, especially on a larger codebase.

However, the pre increment operator is also useful, so don't be afraid to use it.
:::

### Increment (<span class="text-lime-600 dark:text-lime-400">++</span>)
The increment operator increases a number by one.

- **Pre-Increment (`++x`)**: Increases the value before using it.
- **Post-Increment (`x++`)**: Uses the value first, then increases it.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let x = 5;
console.log(++x);
console.log(x++);
console.log(x);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
6 // Pre-Increment
6 // Post-Increment, but x becomes 7 after this line is done executing;
7 // x is 7 after this line#
```
</details>

### Decrement (<span class="text-rose-600 dark:text-rose-400">- -</span>)
The decrement operator decreases a number by one. There are the same two types as well

- **Pre-Decrement (`--x`)**: Decreases the value before using it.
- **Post-Decrement (`x--`)**: Uses the value first, then decreases it.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let y = 5;
console.log(--y);
console.log(y--);
console.log(y);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
4 // Pre-Decrement
4 // Post-Decrement, but y becomes 3 after this line is done executing;
3 // y is 3 after this line
```
</details>

## Order of Operations

Just like in math, you can use parentheses to control the order of operations in your code:

<Tabs syncKey="parentheses">
    <TabItem label="Without ()">
```python title="Numbers.js"
print(2 + 3 * 5)
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="With ()">
```python title="Numbers.js"
print((2 + 3) * 5)
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs syncKey="parentheses">
    <TabItem label="Without ()">
```md title="Output"
17
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="With ()">
```md title="Output"
25
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Order of Operands

1. Parentheses `()`
2. Exponents `**`
3. Multiplication `*`, Division `/`, and Modulus `%`
4. Addition `+` and Subtraction `-`

:::note
The order of execution is the same as the order of operations. Operators with the same precedence / priority are executed from left to right.
