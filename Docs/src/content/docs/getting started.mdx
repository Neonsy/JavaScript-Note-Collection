I'm going to order the sections and sub-topics the same way I'm doing it with the code files. Here's an [example](https://github.com/DrNeonsy/JavaScript-Note-Collection/blob/main/Notes/JavaScript/README.md) for my custom order in markdown for the core module.

## Preparing the journey

Let's quickly go over the setup that I've used for learning and sharing, so you can feel at ease as we dive in.

<Steps>
1. Get a `good` browser

    While most if not all modern browsers are good, I recommend using [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). They have the best developer tools and are the most widely used.

    However, I'm using [Brave](https://brave.com/) for my daily browsing and development. It's a privacy-focused browser that's built on top of Chromium. So you can use any `good` and `modern` browser that sits on top of Chrome in order to get started.

2. Get yourself a text editor or even an IDE
    
    The general recommendation is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is the widely used an known editor that can be expanded upon with extensions.

    Something that will definetly come in handy later, is the [WebstormIDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). It's a paid IDE, but it's worth it if you're going to be doing a lot of web development. It'll also make things easier, when you venture beyound the mere core language.

3. Configure your editors | IDEs

    When it comes to `VSCode`, you can use my [configuration](https://github.com/DrNeonsy/DrNeonsy/tree/main/VSConfig).

    For `WebstormIDE`, I'm providing you with a list of plugins I've installed and settings I've changed.

    Talking about plguins:

    -   .env files support

    -   Astro

    -   Atom Material Icons

    -   CSV Editor

    -   Material Theme UI

    -   Qwik

    -   Rainbow Brackets

    -   React Buddy

    -   React snippets

    -   Solid

    -   Svelte

    Talking about settings:

    -   Theme

    -   Font&ConsoleFont

    -   InlayHints

    -   Package Manager (`pnpm`)

4. Start your journey

    That’s it, you’re ready to go 🚀 so we can now start learning JavaScript. Shall we?
