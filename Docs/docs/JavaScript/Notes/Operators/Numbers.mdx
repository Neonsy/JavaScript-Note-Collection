JavaScript, like any _powerful_ programming language, is packed with a variety of math operators.
Get ready to dive into the exciting world of numbers and calculations.

## Basic Operators

Here is a quick rundown, of all the basic operators you'll need to know for arithmetic in JavaScript.
Try to guess the output, before you look at it or run the code.

### Addition (<span className="text-yellow-600 dark:text-yellow-400">+</span>)
The addition operator adds two numbers together.
It's like combining two ingredients to make a delicious recipe!

```js title="Numbers.js"
let sum = 5 + 3;
console.log(sum);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
8
```
</details>

### Subtraction (<span className="text-red-600 dark:text-red-400">-</span>)
The subtraction operator subtracts one number from another.
Think of it as taking away a piece of a pie.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let difference = 10 - 4;
console.log(difference);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
6
```
</details>

### Multiplication (<span className="text-sky-600 dark:text-sky-400">*</span>)
The multiplication operator multiplies two numbers.
It's like doubling a recipe to serve more people.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let product = 7 * 6;
console.log(product);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
42
```
</details>

### Division (<span className="text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-400">/</span>)
The division operator divides one number by another.
Imagine slicing a pizza into equal parts.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let quotient = 20 / 4;
console.log(quotient);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
5
```
</details>

## Extra Operators

### Modulus (<span className="text-lime-600 dark:text-lime-400">%</span>)
The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation.
It's like finding out how many pieces are left after sharing equally.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let remainder = 10 % 3;
console.log(remainder);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
1
```
</details>

### Exponent (<span className="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">**</span>)
The exponentiation operator raises the first number to the power of the second number.
It's like multiplying a number by itself and that several times over.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let power = 2 ** 3;
console.log(power);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
8
```
</details>

## Increment and Decrement

There are two types of increment and decrement operators:

- **Pre**-in/decrement: Uses the value after, then increases/decreases it.
- **Post**-in/decrement: Uses the value first, then increases/decreases it.

:::info
Chances are, that you'll see the post increment operator more often.
This is because it's easier to read, especially on a larger codebase.

However, the pre increment operator is also useful, so don't be afraid to use it.
:::

### Increment (<span className="text-lime-600 dark:text-lime-400">++</span>)
The increment operator increases a number by one.

- **Pre-Increment (`++x`)**: Increases the value before using it.
- **Post-Increment (`x++`)**: Uses the value first, then increases it.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let x = 5;
console.log(++x);
console.log(x++);
console.log(x);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
6 // Pre-Increment
6 // Post-Increment, but x becomes 7 after this line is done executing;
7 // x is 7 after this line#
```
</details>

### Decrement (<span className="text-rose-600 dark:text-rose-400">- -</span>)
The decrement operator decreases a number by one. There are the same two types as well

- **Pre-Decrement (`--x`)**: Decreases the value before using it.
- **Post-Decrement (`x--`)**: Uses the value first, then decreases it.

```js title="Numbers.js"
let y = 5;
console.log(--y);
console.log(y--);
console.log(y);
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>
```js title="Output"
4 // Pre-Decrement
4 // Post-Decrement, but y becomes 3 after this line is done executing;
3 // y is 3 after this line
```
</details>

## Order of Operations

Just like in math, you can use parentheses to control the order of operations in your code:

<Tabs groupId="parentheses">
    <TabItem value="Without ()" label="Without ()">
```python title="Numbers.js"
print(2 + 3 * 5)
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="With ()" label="With ()">
```python title="Numbers.js"
print((2 + 3) * 5)
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs groupId="parentheses">
    <TabItem value="Without ()" label="Without ()">
```md title="Output"
17
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="With ()" label="With ()">
```md title="Output"
25
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Order of Operands

1. Parentheses `()`
2. Exponents `**`
3. Multiplication `*`, Division `/`, and Modulus `%`
4. Addition `+` and Subtraction `-`

:::info
The order of execution is the same as the order of operations. Operators with the same precedence / priority are executed from left to right.

With these operators, you can perform a variety of mathematical operations in JavaScript.
Whether you're adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing, these tools will help you manipulate numbers with ease and make your code more dynamic and powerful!

Now with the most basic things covered, we can start taking a look into receiving input from the user.
