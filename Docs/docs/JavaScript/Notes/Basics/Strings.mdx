Strings are used to represent text.
They are one of the most common data types you'll work with, and JavaScript provides a rich set of methods to manipulate them.
Let's dive into some of the basics and useful methods for working with strings.

## Creating Strings

You can create strings using single quotes, double quotes, or backticks ([for template literals](#template-literals)).

```js
let singleQuote = 'Hello, world!';
let doubleQuote = "Hello, world!";
let templateLiteral = `Hello, world!`;
```

### Concatinating Strings

Usually, when you use the `+` operator, it adds up the values on the right side to the value on the left side.
Howecver, that changes in the context of strings.

You can concatinate strings using the `+` operator.
This is the same as using the `concat()` method.

:::info
Concatenation means joining two or more strings together.
:::

```js title="Strings.js"
let str = "Hello, world!";
console.log(str + " How are you?");
```

```js title="Result"
Hello, world! How are you?
```

## Finding Length

Use the `length` property to find out how many characters are in a string.

```js title="Strings.js"
let str = "Hello, world!";
console.log(str.length);
```

```js title="Result"
13
```

## Accessing Characters

You can access characters in a string using bracket notation.

```js title="Strings.js"
console.log(str[0]); // "H"
console.log(str.charAt(0)); // "H"
```

```js title="Result"
H
H
```

### Bracket Notation (Index)

The bracket notation is used to access characters in a string by their index.
In JavaScript, the index starts at `0`, meaing that the first character is at index `0`.

:::info
You can find more examples regarding indexing at the array section.
:::

```js title="Strings.js"
let str = "Hello, world!";
console.log(str[0]); // "H"
console.log(str[1]); // "e"
console.log(str[6]); // " "
console.log(str[7]); // "w"
console.log(str[12]); // "!"
```

## Changing Case

`toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()` are used to change the case of a string.

```js title="Strings.js"
console.log(str.toUpperCase());
console.log(str.toLowerCase());
```

```js title="Result"
HELLO, WORLD!
hello, world!
```

## Trimming Whitespace

`trim()` removes whitespace from both ends of a string.

```js title="Strings.js"
let spacedStr = "  Hello, world!  ";
console.log(spacedStr.trim());
```

```js title="Result"
Hello, world!
```

## Extracting Substrings

`substring(start, end)` extracts characters from `start` to `end` (not including `end`).

```js title="Strings.js"
console.log(str.substring(0, 5));
```

```js title="Result"
Hello
```

## Replacing Content

`replace(searchValue, newValue)` replaces occurrences of `searchValue` with `newValue`.

```js title="Strings.js"
console.log(str.replace("world", "JavaScript"));
```

```js title="Result"
Hello, JavaScript!
```

## Splitting and Joining

The `split(separator)` splits a string into an array of substrings.

The `join(separator)` joins an array of strings into a single string, so it's basically the opposite of `split()`.

```js title="Strings.js"
let strArray = str.split(", ");
console.log(strArray);
console.log(strArray.join(" - "));
```

```js title="Result"
["Hello", "world!"]
Hello - world!
```

## Searching in Strings

`indexOf(searchValue)` returns the index of the first occurrence of `searchValue`.

```js title="Strings.js"
console.log(str.indexOf("world"));
```

```js title="Result"
7
```

## Template Literals

Template literals are a powerful way to work with strings, especially when you need to include variables or expressions.

```js title="Strings.js"
let name = "Alice";
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greeting);
```

```js title="Result"
Hello, Alice!
```

Template literals can also span multiple lines.

```js title="Strings.js"
let multiLine = `This is a string
that spans multiple
lines.`;
console.log(multiLine);
```

```js title="Result"
This is a string
that spans multiple
lines.
```

## Next

Working with strings / or text in general is a very important part of JavaScript (or any programming language really).

With Strings now covered as well, I think now it's a good time to look at type conversion.
