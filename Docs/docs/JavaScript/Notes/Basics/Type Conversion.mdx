Type conversion in JavaScript is all about changing a value from one type to another.
It can happen either because you explicitly asked for it or because JavaScript decided to do it behind the scenes.

## Explicit Type Conversion

When you explicitly convert types, you're in control. Here's how you do it:

### To a String

Use the `String()` function to turn a value into a string.

```js title="Type Conversion.js"
String(123);
String(true);
```

```js title="Result"
"123"
"true"
```

### To a Number

Use the `Number()` function to change a value into a number.

```js title="Type Conversion.js"
Number("123");
Number("123abc");
```

```js title="Result"
123
NaN
```

As you can see, if something cannot be converted to a number, it will return `NaN`.

### To a Boolean

Use the `Boolean()` function to convert a value to a boolean.

```js title="Type Conversion.js"
Boolean(1);
Boolean(0);
```

```js title="Result"
true
false
```

It is important to note that `Boolean()` will return `true` for any value that is not `0` or `false`.

## Implicit Type Conversion

Implicit type conversion happens automatically and can sometimes be surprising. Here are some common situations:

### String Concatenation with `+` Operator

When you use `+` with a string and another type, JavaScript converts the other type to a string.

```js title="Type Conversion.js"
"The answer is " + 42
```

```js title="Result"
"The answer is 42"
```

### Numeric Conversion in Arithmetic Operations

Operations like `-`, `*`, and `/` convert values to numbers.

```js title="Type Conversion.js"
"5" - 2
"5" * 2
```

```js title="Result"
3
10
```

Understanding type conversion in JavaScript helps you write code that's both predictable and bug-free. Explicit conversions are usually clearer and safer than relying on implicit ones.
