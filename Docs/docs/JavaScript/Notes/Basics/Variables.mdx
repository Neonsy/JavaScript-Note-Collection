Variables are a way to store data in your code.
They are used to store information that you want to use later on.

One of the classNameic examples is to imagine a ðŸ“¦ box that you can put things in.
In order to find whatever is in the box, you need to know in which box it is.

This is done by giving them names.
After that, you can put whatever you want in the box and refer to it by its name.

## Naming conventions

There are a few naming conventions that you should follow when naming variables:

- Variables should start with a lowercase letter

- Variables should only contain letters, numbers and underscores

- Variables should not start with a number

- Variables should not contain spaces

- Variables should be descriptive

- Variables should use camelCase

These are only guidelines, but they will help others to understand your code better.
If you are getting used to this, you'll also have an easier time, reading someone else's code.

### Case Styles

Here's a short list of case styles:

- <span className="text-orange-700 dark:text-orange-400 font-bold">camelCase</span> (e.g. myVariableName)

- <span className="text-orange-700 dark:text-orange-400 font-bold">PascalCase</span> (e.g. MyFunctionName)

- snake_case

- <span className="text-orange-700 dark:text-orange-400 font-bold">SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</span> (e.g. MY_CONSTANT)

- UPPERCASE

- lowercase

## Creating a variable

There are two ways to create a variable.
The first one is to use the `let` keyword.
The second one is to use the `const` keyword.

:::info
The `var` keyword is deprecated and should not be used.
:::

If you wish to learn more about the difference between `let` and `const`, you can [read about it here](/JavaScript-Note-Collection/blog/JavaScript/Const%20VS%20Let).

So as we've established before, a variable is a way to store data.
That data can be of any type.
In order to use that data, you need to give it a name.

```js title="Variables.js"
let name = "Amadeus";
```

:::info
You do not need to use a `;` semicolon at the end of a line.

A semicolon is only truely needed when you have several statements on the same line.

**However**, it is recommended to use it. It'll also make a switch to another programming language easier.

### Declartion vs Assignment

Creating a variable, as you've already seen above, can be broken down into two parts.

The **declaration** is where you define the variable.
This is marked by either the `const` or `let` keyword and then followed by the name of the variable.

The **assignment** is where you put data into the variable.
This is done by specifying the name of the variable and then assigning it a value, using the `=` sign.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Declaration" label="Declaration">
```js title="Variables.js"
const name;
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Assignment" label="Assignment">
```js title="Variables.js"
name = "Amadeus";
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Changing a variable

As the name suggest, a `normal` variable can be changed.
This is simply done by reassigning it.
In other words, it's the same prodcedure as when you put something in a box.
The only differnce is that you don't use the `let` keyword again.

```js title="Variables.js"
let name = "Grande";
name = "Petrick";

console.log(name);
```

Try to guess the output before looking at it or running the code.

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>
```md title="Result"
Petrick
```
</details>

## Constant variables

Constant variables are variables that you can't change.
This is done by using the `const` keyword.
However, this behavior is not the same for more complex data types.
As mentioned before, if you want to find out about the differences and details, I encourage you to read about [const vs let](/JavaScript-Note-Collection/blog/JavaScript/Const%20VS%20Let).

```js title="Variables.js"
const PI = 3.141592653589793;
```

## Next
Now that we know how to create and use variables, we can start learning about how to perform mathmatical operations on them.
Don't worry, you don't have to be a fan of math to understand it.
