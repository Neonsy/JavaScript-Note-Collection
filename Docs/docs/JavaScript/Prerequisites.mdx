If you decide to follow along with this documentation, you'll probably want to have a directory, which has a similar structure to the following:

-   your-project/
    -   index.html
    -   style.css
    -   **index.js**

The `index.js` file is where you'll be writing your code.

In case you decide to use the files, provided by this [repository](https://github.com/Neonsy/JavaScript-Note-Collection/tree/main/Notes), you can find them in the `/JavaScript` directory, which is structured like the sidebar navigation.

So your directory could look like this:

-   your-project/
    -   index.html
    -   style.css
    -   index.js
    -   **Notes**
        -   JavaScript/
            -   README.md
            -   Basics/
                -   variables.js
                -   ....
            -   ....
        -   .gitignore
        -   README.md

:::info
When it comes to more complex projects like working with `NodeJs`, you'll want to use a different structure, but I'll show you how to do that as soon as it gets to that.
:::

In that case you can just load the `index.js` file in your `index.html` file, to run your own code and load one of the other files as needed.
You can also just copy & paste from the `notes` into your own `index.js` file.

## Next

Now that you probably and / or hopefully have a project sturcture in place, you can start writing your own code.
We'll start by looking into comments and how to output data to the console.
